# Hi there 

We’re SmileDirectClub, and we believe everyone deserves a smile they’ll love. We also believe that you deserve a job you’ll love. Good thing you found us, and we found you.

Since we started in 2014, we've made over a million new smiles all around the world. Our customers’ before and happily-ever-after photos speak for themselves. More than 80% of people could benefit from orthodontic care, yet only 1% receive it each year, with convenience and cost being the biggest issue. SmileDirectClub exists to bridge that gap.

If spreading smiles around the world sounds like something you could sink your teeth into, we want to talk to you!

# About the role

This is a unique opportunity to join our highly autonomous, self-organizing, cross-functional AI team to shape the future of high-tech, direct-to-consumer telehealth.

We’re looking for engineers with strong empathy for the end users, an expertise around mobile video capture and/or streaming, and a deep overall understanding of the iOS platform to help us craft world-class user experiences and products that are on the forefront of what’s technologically possible.

As a key member of our small, tightly-knit team, you will have lots of ownership and impact on the mobile products and concepts we’re building from the very beginning, and use the latest iOS technologies to help us tackle tough design, product, and technological problems.

Although ultimately we’re working towards end-user products, this position would entail extensive experimentation and prototyping aimed at system experiences of the future, and you will be working very closely with a few other software engineers, designers, and ML scientists on our team to iterate quickly and ship early and often.

As a team, we value empathy, curiosity, candor, diversity of thought, helping each other, building on top of each others’ work, and psychological safety that allows us to bring our best, whole selves to work.

We're looking for creative, out-of-the-box thinkers who love their craft, question the status quo, go out of their way to help a colleague, speak up when they see a problem, and believe the only dumb question is the one not asked. Bonus points are if you’re interested not only in building cool products but also in the mechanics of highly functioning teams.
